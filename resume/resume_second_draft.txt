Experience

Smithsonian Institution 
National Ballast Information Clearinghouse (NBIC)
IT Specialist: 2005-Present

Summary:
The NBIC, overseen by the U.S. Coast Guard, was tasked by the U.S. Congress to collect, analyze, and report on ballast water delivery from commercial vessels to the waters of the United States.  The NBIC annually receives ~120,000 reports via multiple streams and in a multitude of formats.

Role:
1. Design, develop, test, deploy, debug, and expand the database/applications/scripts that comprise the NBIC information system, including:  
    * receipt of reports via online application, email, and fax 
    * data extraction/entry from reports received in multiple formats
    * preparation of data for analysis 
    * evaluation/scoring of reports
    * generation of responses for report submissions
    * quality control systems
    * management of multiple MySQL databases and scripts for migrating data between instances
2. Communicate the role and functionality of technical solutions to analysts, managers, and US Coast Guard supervisors.  
3. Provide training and support for users of technical solutions.

Accomplishments:
* Oversaw transition from paper to paperless: 
    * Flipped submission ratio from >90% fax reports to >95% electronic reports.
* Improved operational efficiency:  
    * Eliminated 100,000+ report backlog within first year of employment. 
    * Reduced average time from receipt to processed report from ~10 months to 1.08 days.
    * Reduced required manpower from 8 to 1.5 full time equivalent positions. 
* Improved data quality:
    * Successfully solicited corrections to an average of ~8,000 reports annually.
    * Effectually eliminated >50 problematic errors from reporting population.
* Spearheaded implementation of the web application for data submissions.  
    * Foresaw the advantage of bringing report validation prior to submission and successfully convinced management of this utility.
    * Personally directed training to learn web application development.  
    * Effectively lobbied NBIC/US Coast Guard management to alter reporting requirements to allow reporting after arrival, to increase vessel access to networks and adoptability of web application for reporting.
